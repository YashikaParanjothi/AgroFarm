# AgroFarm
Agriculture is the backbone of Indian Economy. In spite of this, today, the people involved in agriculture belongs to the lower class and is in deep poverty. Even after all the hard work and effort put in by the farmers for the production of crop, in today’s market the farmers are cheated by the intermediary agents, which is extremely unfair.

Our project – AgroFarm – a web application – aims to help farmers to sell their products directly from their farm to consumers without any intermediate fraud agents, thus highly benefitting the farmers. This project uses PostgreSQL for backend and HTML, CSS for frontend and PHP for connecting the frontend and backend.
